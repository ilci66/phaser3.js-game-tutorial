# Phaser.js Tutorial

## About Project
Following the tutorial in the phaser.js library to create a simple platform game. This tutorial will help me see the working of the phaser library so I can create my own games in the future (mostly as a hobby).

Taking my notes on the html pages as I go and changing-testing values and variables.
